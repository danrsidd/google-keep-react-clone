# Stickiez: A Google Keep React Clone

## About The Project

Welcome to my take on Google Keep! Stickiez is a React.js clone of Google Keep using React Hooks and Sass (SCSS). Though the main focus of this project was on the front end, it utilizes the broswers local storage to store your stickies so that you don't lose them on refresh.
